# DevicesScannerEsp8266
This simple software controls the esp8266 TTGO 0.91 oled board.
It shows the number of discovered access points and clients, and alerts the user with a sound.
Additionally it shows the mac address of the client with the strongest signal.
Old mac addresses are removed from the memory, the time interval is defined in the PURGETIME constant.

This project is based on the great work of Ray Burnette: https://www.hackster.io/rayburne/esp8266-mini-sniff-f6b93a and Andreas Spiess https://github.com/SensorsIot/Wi-Fi-Sniffer-as-a-Human-detector

I designed a case that contains the TTGO board and a 18650 lithium battery to make this device extremely portable.
